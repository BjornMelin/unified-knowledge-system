# Architecture: Unified Knowledge Management System

This document provides a detailed overview of the Unified Knowledge Management System architecture, explaining how each component works together to create a comprehensive knowledge access solution.

## System Architecture Overview

Our system consists of six distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility in the knowledge flow:

1. **Web Content Acquisition Layer**: Responsible for gathering information from multiple sources
2. **Knowledge Processing Layer**: Processes raw content into structured knowledge
3. **Knowledge Storage Layer**: Stores processed knowledge in specialized databases
4. **MCP Server Layer**: Exposes knowledge via standardized Machine Comprehension Protocol
5. **Integration Layer**: Unifies access across different knowledge sources
6. **Client Layer**: End-user applications that consume unified knowledge

## Detailed Layer Descriptions

### 1. Web Content Acquisition Layer

This layer is responsible for acquiring content from various sources:

**DevDocs Integration**
- Free and open-source documentation crawler (364 GitHub stars)
- Processes up to 1000 pages/minute
- Focuses on technical documentation, API references, and developer resources
- Supports incremental crawling and content change detection

**Firecrawl Integration**
- Commercial web crawler ($16/month)
- Processes approximately 20 pages/minute
- Handles general web content, blogs, news sites, and research papers
- Supports JavaScript rendering for dynamic content
- Provides advanced filtering and content extraction capabilities
